## Product Owner
- Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the development team
- Sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog 
- Orders the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
- Ensures that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next
- Ensures that the Development team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed
- Is one person, not a commitee

---
class: middle

## Developer
- Does the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint
- Empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work
- Self-organizing; No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into increments of potentially releasable functionality
- Are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create the product
- Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer
- Team should be "small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint."

## Scrum Master
- A servant-leader for the Scrum Team
- Leads
  - Responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted
  - Facilitates Scrum events

## The Sprint

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

### During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned

---
class: middle

## Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. 

- Development Team forecasts the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint
- Only the development team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint
- Create the Sprint Backlog

---
class: middle

## Daily Scrum (Standup)

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

  ### Three Questions
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

## Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the completed items from the Sprint Backlog and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. 

- The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved
- The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Sprint
- Result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint

class: middle

## Sprint Retrospective 

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work

## Product Backlog
- Ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product
- Dynamic; constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful
- Lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases

## Sprint Backlog
- Set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint
- Forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Sprint and the work 
needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" state
